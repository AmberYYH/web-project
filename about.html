     <h5 class="about-taiwan-titile">About Taiwan</h5>
    
     <p  class="about-taiwan-paragraph">Name of the island: In his Daoyi Zhilüe (1349), Wang Dayuan used "Liuqiu" as a name for the island, 
        or the part of it closest to Penghu. Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa specifically; 
        the name Ryūkyū is the Japanese form of Liúqiú. The name also appears in the Book of Sui (636) and other early works, but scholars 
        cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.</p>
        
     <p  class="about-taiwan-paragraph">The name Formosa (福爾摩沙) dates from 1542, when 
        Portuguese sailors noted it on their maps as Ilha Formosa (Portuguese for "beautiful island"). The name Formosa eventually 
        "replaced all others in European literature" and remained in common use among English speakers into the 20th century.
        In 1603, a Chinese expedition fleet anchored at a place in Taiwan called Dayuan, a variant of "Taiwan". 
        In the early 17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a commercial post at Fort Zeelandia (modern-day Anping) on a 
        coastal sandbar called "Tayouan", after their ethnonym for a nearby Taiwanese aboriginal tribe, possibly Taivoan people. 
        This name was also adopted into the Chinese vernacular as the name of the sandbar and nearby area (Tainan).</p>

     <p  class="about-taiwan-paragraph">The modern word "Taiwan" 
        is derived from this usage, which is written in different transliterations (大員，大圓，大灣，臺員，臺圓 or 臺窩灣) in Chinese historical records. 
        The area occupied by modern-day Tainan was the first permanent settlement by both European colonists and Chinese immigrants. The settlement 
        grew to be the island's most important trading center and served as its capital until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name (臺灣 / 台灣) became 
        official as early as 1684 during the Qing dynasty with the establishment of Taiwan Prefecture centered in modern-day Tainan. 
        Through its rapid development the entire Taiwanese mainland eventually became known as "Taiwan".</p>
